Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Three key milestones in software engineering evolution.

1 The Birth of Software Engineering.

2The shift to Object orientated programming.

3The birth of Agile

1.	The Birth of Software Engineering (1968 – NATO Conference)

Before the 1960s, software was often developed without structured processes, leading to unreliable systems and delays. The 1968 NATO Conference officially introduced software engineering as a discipline to tackle the “software crisis” by promoting structured methodologies, modular design, and better project management.

2.	The Shift to Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)

As software complexity grew, structured programming wasn’t enough. OOP emerged, emphasizing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Languages like Smalltalk, C++, and later Java made code more reusable, scalable, and maintainable, revolutionizing how software was designed.

3.	The Agile Revolution (2001 – Agile Manifesto)

Traditional Waterfall methods were too rigid, slowing down software delivery. The Agile Manifesto introduced a flexible, iterative approach that prioritized customer collaboration, working software, and quick adaptation to change. Agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban reshaped modern development practices.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Software development life cycle Stages;

•	Planning and Requirements analysis.

•	Defining requirements.

•	Designing architecture 

•	Developing the product

•	Product testing and Integration.

•	Deployment and Maintenance 



Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis

This phase is essential in software development. Developers gather requirements from customers, sales teams, and market surveys. The collected information forms the foundation of the project. Effective planning ensures a high-quality outcome, shaping the initial design based on available data.

Stage 2: Defining Requirements

All software requirements are specified and approved by customers, market analysts, and stakeholders. This is documented in the Software Requirement Specification (SRS), which outlines everything needed for the project throughout its lifecycle.

Stage 3: Designing Architecture

Using the Software Requirement Specification (SRS), designers create multiple architectural designs, documented in the Design Document Specification (DDS). 

Market analysts and stakeholders review these designs, and the most practical one is selected for development.

Stage 4: Developing the Product

At this stage, developers begin coding based on the Design Document Specification (DDS). They follow set protocols and use tools like compilers, interpreters, and debuggers. Programming languages such as C/C++, Python, and Java are chosen based on project requirements.

Stage 5: Product Testing and Integration

After development, thorough testing is conducted to ensure smooth execution. While minimal testing happens throughout SDLC, this stage focuses on identifying, fixing, and retesting flaws to meet Software Requirement Specification (SRS) standards.

Documentation provides essential information on software processes, functions, and maintenance. It also guides users on product usage. Training enhances employee skills and understanding to improve performance.

Stage 6: Deployment and Maintenance

After testing, the product is released in phases and tested in real environments. If it performs well, it is fully deployed. Feedback is gathered for improvements, and updates are made as needed. Ongoing maintenance ensures continued performance and reliability.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

•	Flexibility: Waterfall is rigid, changes are difficult to implement while Agile, changes are made anytime.

•	Approach: Waterfall is sequential,structured and linear while  Agile is iterative, flexible and incremental.

•	Delivery: Waterfall , the final product is delivered at the end while in  Agile, there is frequent releases of working software.

•	Documentation: In Waterfall, there is heavy documentation before development while in Agile there is minimal documentation, it focuses on working software.



When to Use Waterfall

1.	Well-Defined Requirements – When project requirements are clear, stable, and unlikely to change.

2.	Regulated Industries – Projects requiring strict compliance, such as healthcare software or financial systems.

3.	Large-Scale Projects – When a structured approach is necessary to coordinate multiple teams, like infrastructure development.

4.	Fixed Budget & Timeline – If cost and time constraints are set, such as in construction or hardware manufacturing

When to Use Agile

1.	Uncertain or Evolving Requirements – When requirements are expected to change over time, such as in start-ups or product development.

2.	Fast-Paced Environments – When speed to market is crucial, like mobile app development.

3.	Customer-Centric Projects – If continuous user feedback is essential, such as e-commerce or SaaS platforms.

4.	High Innovation & Experimentation – Where quick iterations are needed, like AI/ML development or gaming applications.
